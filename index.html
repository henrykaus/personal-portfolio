          Hi, I’m Henry — a Computer Science student at Portland State slated to
          graduate in March 2024. Through being admitted into the PSU
          Cooperative Education Program (PCEP) internship, I have been given the
          opportunity to work in several Portland tech companies through varying
          6-month positions.
          <br /><br />
          This includes a Quality Assurance Automation Engineering role at
          Trimble Viewpoint where I created API tests in Cypress, front-end UI
          tests in Selenium, and API performance tests in BlazeMeter along with
          communicating any nightly failures across several teams. In my current
          internship role, I have taken on a Software Development position with
          Jama Software creating front-end components in React.js for their
          enterprise-facing application.
          <br /><br />
          Through my studies and job experience, I have developed a drive for
          problem-solving and a hunger to learn more. I consistently find myself
          enveloped in whatever challenge rests in front of me, making use of
          both my own abilities as well as those around me. I can’t wait to see
          what’s to come, and please reach out to me as I'd love to share more.

                A web app that provides information in regards to historical
                temperatures for almost any location in the world. Utilizing
                free public <b>APIs</b>, the web app charts the past ~22 years
                of high and low temperatures per month for any input location.
                In addition, the web app displays a couple widgets with the
                current month's min and max temp for the area as well as a
                percent difference to the year prior. <br /><br />
                In regards to the app's tech stack, it is primarily built on the
                Python-based framework
                <b>Flask</b> with some <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> and a tiny bit
                of <b>JavaScript</b> to get a graph displaying. For weather
                information, it takes text input for any location to hand to the

                to do the language processing and return a set of latitude,

                The playoff bracket generator is a terminal-based <b>C++</b> app
                that can create, seed, and store playoff brackets for any
                base-two number of teams. It has a simple user interface that
                allows users to progress teams through a custom bracket. On
                using the CLI, it has options for the removal or modification of
                existing files in its simplified file system. <br /><br />
                The inspiration for this project was that I wanted to automate
                the creation fantasy-like brackets in a now-past soccer playoff

                The monocular depth estimator was a research project that took
                place in Winter 2023 for extracting depth information from a
                single 2D RGB image given as little information as possible.
                Using a pretrained <b>transfer learning</b> modal and the
                <b>NYU Depth Dataset V2</b>, my team was able to script a
