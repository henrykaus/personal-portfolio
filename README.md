# Personal Portfolio

Here is my interactive personal portfolio website. This site was originally created as the final project for **CS 463: Intro to Web Development**. On this site, you will find sections about myself, work experience, my capstone project, and other past projects, along with a responsive nav bar to jump to each section. Along with the overarching goal of creating a sleek looking portfolio for myself, I also took accessibility into heavy consideration which dictated many of the element and color-contrast selections. Responsiveness was also a major focus and you should hopefully find that the site will appear pleasant on a wide-array of display sizes. Most recently, support for numerous right-to-left languages were added upon setting a browser-based translation.
